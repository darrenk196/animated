# Animation Template

This project was a fun exercise to practice my web development skills. I used a free template from Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework for building responsive websites. I added some animations using AOS (Animate On Scroll), a library that allows you to animate elements as they scroll into view. I also used RandomUser API, a service that generates random user data, to populate the website with some dummy profiles. The result was a simple but attractive landing page for a fictional company.
